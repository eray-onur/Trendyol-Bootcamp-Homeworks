## Performance

- Category images aren't appropriately sized to cellular data (minor issue as this is a desktop-specific page).

## Accessibility (Lowest Point)

- 'Favourite' button does not have an accessible name, which screen readers announce only as 'button', making the buttons ambiguous for screen reader reliant users.

- Document doesn't even have a <title> element!

- Product images don't have alt tags.

- Certain anchor links don't have intelligible names, which makes the screen reader reliant users' navigation experience worse.

- Search input has the same issue as with Homepage search input.

- Lists contain other types of elements than <li>.

## Best Practices

- Same issues as homepage.

## SEO

- Document doesn't even have a <title> element!

- No meta description

- Page is blocked from indexing (not an issue if it's intentional)

- Product images don't have alt tags.
